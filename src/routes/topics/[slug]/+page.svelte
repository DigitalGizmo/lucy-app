    <h2>Control and Resistance</h2>
    <p>Slave owners, civic leaders, and ministers attempted to dictate most aspects of slaves’ lives. Massachusetts laws mandated a curfew for all slaves and forbade their consumption of alcohol. The Reverend Benjamin Wadsworth linked Christian virtue to obedience: “When your master or Mistress bids you do this or that, Christ bids you do it, because he [Christ] bids you obey them.” Despite these coercive efforts, slaves found a variety of ways to exercise some personal control over their lives and culture.</p>

    <p>In 1749, Prince ran away from Joseph Barnard, taking with him extra clothing, a gun, and a violin that he could use or barter for his survival on the road. His freedom was short-lived; he died back in Deerfield in1752. Other forms of resis-tance included theft and holding clandestine meetings; as late as the 1840s, Deerfield residents still remembered that some-time in the 1760s, Titus and several other slaves “belonging to some of the most respectable people” stole food and rum and gathered for a frolic at a “place of resort.” The risk inherent in such activities was dramatically demonstrated when Titus and the other slaves were caught and whipped.  Jenny, abducted from her African home as a young girl, continued throughout her life to collect small objects in preparation for her spirit’s return to Africa, maintaining her African beliefs despite de-cades of servitude in a minister’s household.</p>
